# Gesture-Recognition-Unlock
This file is about the project of Real-Time Embedded System 2020 Spring of NYU
Objective:
● Use the data collected from a single accelerometer and/or magnetometer to
record a hand movement sequence as a means to generally “unlock” a resource.
● Recorded sequence must be saved on the microcontroller, using a “Record Key”
feature.
● User then must replicate the key sequence within sufficient tolerances to unlock
the resource.
● A successful unlock must be indicated by a visual indication, such as an LED or
similar indicator

Restrictions:
● This is an individual project to be done independently by each student
● Only one microcontroller and one accelerometer/MPU may be used. The may be
connected with any length cabling.
● Any programming environment may be used (Atmel Studio, Arduino, etc.)
● You will be allowed to use drivers/HAL functions available through the IDE
● The accelerometer/MPU must be held in a closed fist of either hand while
performing the mechanical sequence
● An “enter key” and ”record” functionality must be developed to so the user knows
when to start the sequence of unlocking and recording respectively.

My project is based on Arduino Mege2560. There are two codes -- one is for gesture record and another is 
for geture recognition.
